description="""
The **AE.01 API** provides unified REST endpoints to manage an industrial robotics cell built from an Igus actuator, UFactory xArm manipulator, and Symovo AGV.

---

**Warning:**  
This API is a work in progress and subject to change.  
Features, endpoints, and response formats may evolve as development continues.  
Unexpected bugs are possible â€” use with caution and check for updates regularly.

---

### Quick start

1. Check system status: **`/api/v1/robot/status`**
2. Robot reconfig to transport position: **`/api/v1/robot/move/to_transport_position`**
3. Move robot to product: **`/api/v1/robot/move/to_product`**
4. **Manually pick up the product:**  
Open http://robot_ip:port/control web page and execute the grasp action manually.
5. Place product in box: **`/api/v1/robot/move/to_box_1`** or **`/api/v1/robot/move/to_box_2`**
6. Disable Gripper **`api/v1/xarm/manipulator/drop`**

- All endpoints are available on the local network, no authentication required.
- Composite endpoints coordinate multiple subsystems for you.
- Non-200 responses include error messages for debugging.
- See individual tags for device-specific endpoints.
